						<p>We often receive replies from multiple teachers, and we can only select one. We will do our best to notify you if you are not selected.  Also, we take the following into account:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Many times, it is first come, first served!  Request promptly and often!</li>
						<li>Positive: teachers who maintain an upbeat attitude.</li>
						<li>Positive: teachers who register a high % of students.</li>
						<li>Positive: teachers whose students continue lessons for a long time (over one year).</li>
						<li>Most positive factor: referrals from other Musika students!</li>

						<p>Teachers who receive a high number of referrals become our “go to” teachers. Referrals demonstrate that students like your attitude and style enough to recommend you to others.  Actively promoting yourself as a Musika teacher to students and parents is an important aspect of how we get new students, and also gives you more students and a bigger paycheck too.  Remember: as stated in the teacher contract, all referrals must be officially registered through Musika.</p>
						<p>To initiate a referral, a student or parent must <strong>call (877) 685-4524</strong> and request you as their teacher, or you can collect their contact info and send it to our office by email or telephone. We also always welcome referrals from students for different instruments than you teach, or for students you know you may not be able to teach, due to scheduling or other factors.</p> 
						<h5 >Factors that could PREVENT an assignment:</h5>
						<ul><li>Previous complaints from students.</li>
						<li>Students that are assigned to you habitually do not register with you.</li>
						<li>Students that are assigned to you do not even take an introductory lesson.</li>
						<li>Breaching the contract. Actions which are considered a breach of contract include (but are not limited to):</li>
						</ul>
						<ol>
						<li>Teaching referrals from any Musika student outside of the Musika program. Referrals from students must register through Musika.</li>
						<li>Promoting/discussing your own teaching business and fees with our students.</li>
						<li>Discussing with any parent/student your Musika pay scale or any other financial matters.</li>
						<li>Cancelling/stopping lessons or taking time off without prior notification. </li>
						<li>Taking students out of the program at any time.</li>
						</ol>
						<h5 >I prefer students all in the same area so I don't have to travel as much. How can I do this?</h5>
						<p>The key is to build up your student base through Musika one student at a time. As your students increase, you can create a healthy schedule of back-to-back lessons. If you let us know that you have a student that is further out than the rest, we can try to give you preference for the next available student in that area.</p>
						<h5 >Could I teach exclusively from my home/studio?</h5>
						<p>Teachers giving lessons in the student’s home is one of our big selling points and makes up roughly 90% of our business. If you refuse to do travel to students, you miss out on 90% of the business you are able to offer.</p>
