                            First, creating/updating your profile at <a href="https://teachers.musikalessons.com/profile">https://teachers.musikalessons.com/profile</a>. Profiles with quality content attract 10 times as many direct requests from clients. The second way is by writing articles for our blog. Send blog articles to <a href="mailto:musika@musikalessons.com"> musika@musikalessons.com</a> The more articles you submit, the more web traffic you will get to your profile on our site, resulting in students for you. Anything related to music is acceptable: reviews of albums, practice tips, guitar tabs of popular songs, even subjects as detailed as how to do vibrato. The options are endless. <b>Note:</b> Due to Google guidelines, if you wish to submit an article that you already published on another site/blog you will need to reword the article in its entirety. Word-for-word duplicate text will not be indexed by Google.

                            If a Musika lead didn't request a teacher specifically from a profile or blog article they liked on our site, you will receive an email about the new student lead. <em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Always review</span></em> the student's schedule and location to see if it fits your availability and travel range. If all looks good, request the student. We suggest being very quick and maintaining a high level of reliability, as only one teacher will ultimately get the lead each time. Lastly, teachers can go to <a href="https://teachers.musikalessons.com/prospectives"> https://teachers.musikalessons.com/prospectives </a> to find a repository of unplaced leads.

                               <em><b>Tip: we strongly recommend calling the student immediately.</b></em> The student will be expecting your phone call. Sales studies show that delays of even a few hours can cause leads to "go cold," resulting in the client looking elsewhere for lessons. We also highly suggest sending a follow-up email with a link to your teacher profile mentioning you left a phone message. To find your profile URL, go to <a href="http://www.musikalessons.com/teachers/search">http://www.musikalessons.com/teachers/search</a> and search for your instrument and zipcode. Once you locate your profile you can copy the url from your web browser into your email.You may also find your profile link at the top of your profile page. A high-quality profile will often prompt a lead to call you back.

                               We recommend scheduling the trial lesson sooner rather than later. Scheduling a lesson weeks down the road gives the student lead an opportunity to find a different teacher before meeting you. <em><b>All trial lessons are 30 minutes.</b></em> If the student registers after the trial with you, they pay Musika for that 30-minute lesson and you will be paid by Musika. The lesson is ONLY free for the student if they do not register with you, in which case you are not compensated (as per your contract with Musika).

						   Instructors must notify Musika 60 days in advance of the end of their contract. Please do not inform any of your students of this until you let Musika know first. We will need to find your students a replacement teacher and have that arranged before you let them know you are leaving Musika.

								<li><h5>Maintain a High Retention Rate</h5><p>Keeping students engaged, learning and progressing week after week is the ultimate goal. New student leads always select teachers that have a high retention rate.</p>
								</li>
								<li><h5>Keep Cancellations to a Minimum</h5><p>Create a teaching environment where students know/feel that cancelling lessons should be kept to a minimum. Industry standard is no more than 2 cancellations every 4 months (not including major holidays). Lead by example by not canceling a lesson unless it's absolutely necessary.</p>
								</li>
								<li><h5>Make-Up Cancelled Lessons</h5><p>The more lessons you teach, the more money you make. If you are having trouble finding a time to make up a cancelled lesson, you can often extend a normally scheduled lesson to cover the missed time. There are options to input longer lessons lengths at your invoicing account found at <a href="https://teachers.musikalessons.com/home">https://teachers.musikalessons.com/home</a></p>
								</li>
								<li><h5>Go for It!</h5><p>Musika receives numerous requests every day. We can never determine where the students will come from. The most successful teachers, particularly those who have many students, have built up their student base one student at a time. Once you start getting students in a certain area, if you continue to request students in that area you hopefully will be able to build up a healthy schedule of back-to-back students. Good luck!</p>
