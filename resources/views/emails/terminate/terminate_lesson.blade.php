Your Music Lessons with {{$details['tname']}}<br />

<div>

<p>Dear {{$details['student_name']}} and/or parents of {{$details['student_name']}},</p>

<p>

Your Musika teacher {{$details['tname']}} has indicated to us here at Musika that {{$details['student_name']}} wishes to stop lessons.

We are sorry to hear that you want to discontinue your lessons, but we hope that Musika has been a positive and enriching musical experience.

</p>
<p>Termination reason:  {{$details['termination_reason']}}</p>
<p>

The only policy we have regarding termination is that the student provides the teacher with <b>two additional lessons as notice</b>.

In addition to being a standard Musika policy, its is also a courtesy to your teacher, to assure that your teacher does not abruptly lose a student.

If you do not wish to take two more lessons, we charge those lessons as a termination fee.

(Please refer to your original registration agreement to verify this policy.)

</p>

<p>

Please respond to this e-mail to notify me which of the two options you'd prefer.

Most students simply prefer to take the additional lessons, so if you'd like to take that route, please inform me of the projected last lesson date and I will note this on your account.

(Please discuss this with your teacher as well.)

Thank you again for joining our program and I wish you the best of luck in your future musical endeavors!
